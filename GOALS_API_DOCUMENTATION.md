## Macro Distribution by Goal Type

| Goal Type | Protein (g/kg) | Fat (% of kcal) | Carbs |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| `lose` (Fat Loss) | 2.0 | 25% | Remainder (~45-50%) |
| `maintain` (Lifestyle) | 1.6 | 30% | Remainder (~50-55%) |
| `gain` (Muscle Gain) | 1.8 | 25% | Remainder (~50-55%) |

### Guardrails
- **Calorie Floor**: Male ≥1500 kcal, Female ≥1200 kcal
- **Protein Minimum**: ≥1.4 g/kg body weight
- **Fat Minimum**: ≥0.6 g/kg body weight

---

## User Profile Integration

After successful calculation, the following fields are updated in the User model:

```javascript
user.goals = {
  goal: "Lose 7.0 kg by March 15",
  dailyCalories: 2050,
  dailyProtein: 165,
  dailyCarbs: 220,
  dailyFats: 55
}
```

These values can then be used throughout the app for:
- Meal tracking comparisons
- Daily progress monitoring
- Notification triggers
- Dashboard displays

---

## Testing

### Get Your JWT Token
First, authenticate to get your JWT token:

```bash
# Request OTP
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/request-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+15715367519"}'

# Verify OTP
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/verify-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+15715367519", "otp": "367519"}'
```

Copy the token from the response and use it in the Authorization header.

### Verify Goals Were Saved
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/users/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Notes

1. The `planData` object is specifically formatted for UI display on the onboarding flow
2. All calculations use the v2 unified energy model (no double-counting of steps/exercise)
3. Calories are rounded to nearest 25, macros to nearest 5g
4. The `goal` description is auto-generated based on current weight, target weight, and pace
5. If `apple_active_kcal_day` is provided, it overrides the activity level and workout calculations
